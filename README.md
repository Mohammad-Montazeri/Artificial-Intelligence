In this repository, 4 computer assignments of the course “*Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning*” lectured by *Dr. Hakimeh Fadaei* have been stored. All of them, except *CA03* which was delivered unfinished due to the project's time limit, recieved almost full marks *or even more, thanks to the bonus sections*. Each folder contains the completed Jupyter Notebook of the assignment, along with its *HTML*output and dependencies like images or datasets. The original manuscript of the project objectives are also included. It's highly recommended to download and open up *report* files using a web browser for a better glance of whole project delivery. 

A brief description of these mini-projects would be:


| CA | Objective | Methods | Description |
|:--:|:---------:|:-------:|:-----------|
|1| Curve Fitting | Genetic Algorithm | We fit the most conformable polynomial to some given data points |
|2| Music Genre Classification | Hidden Markov Models | We classify any given musical track to 4 Genres of Blues, HipHop, Metal, and Pop |
|3| Customers' Purchase Prediction | Machine Learning (Linear and Multiple Regression) | We predict the number of a buyer's purchases in a store based on his/her information and records | 
|4| Agent Control in Game Environments | Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, Value Iteration, Policy Iteration) | We train two agents to find the optimal paths to reach their goals while avoiding obstacles within a *Frozen Lake* and a *Taxi Driver* environments |
